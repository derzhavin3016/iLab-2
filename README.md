# iLab-2
Second semester of iLab course.

## cache
Realization of an ***LFU-cache*** algorithm. Realized element search by **O(1)**. Program counts cache hits.

## Triangles
Profram which get an array of triangles (array of points triplets) and write numbers of triangles, which intersect with any other.Realized my own 3D cartesian space math support headers, such as: 
* ```vec.hpp``` - vector class module.
* ```line.hpp``` - line class module.
* ```plane.hpp``` - plane class module.
* ```trian.hpp``` - triangle class module.
* ```mth.hpp``` - calculating an intersection functions. 

## Tree
**AVL** searching tree algorithm.

## Matrix
Realization of matrix calss. Realized calculating determinant by Gauss algorithm.
